# Enhanced-Plant-Disease-Detection
• Initiated innovative endeavor in agriculture disease detection, surpassing PlantDoc’s 31% accuracy.
• Successfully developed machine learning models capable of accurately classifying plant diseases, with the first model
achieving an accuracy of 30.5% across 28 disease classes and the second model achieving an impressive accuracy of
59.89% across a subset of 13 disease classes.
• Demonstrated the project’s efficacy in achieving high accuracy despite limited data availability, with only 2342
instances utilized for training across both 28 and 13 disease classes.
